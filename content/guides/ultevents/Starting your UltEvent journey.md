UltEvents are the most powerful way (...and the only way) to make functional and advanced items. What are they?
Before we start, make sure to take some time and read their docs, which can be found [here](https://kybernetik.com.au/ultevents/).

UltEvents are very dumbed down visual code - they have been created to replace the default unity events, since they are lacking a lot of features. UltEvents are definitely not intended for how we as modders use them, not in the slightest - to put it simply, we are abusing the ever living shit out of them. 
You can read about the differences between UltEvents and UnityEvents [here](https://kybernetik.com.au/ultevents/docs/ult-vs-unity/).

In the last two years, we managed to find a lot of UltEvents hacks, tricks and unintended behaviours that we can use.

### Time for the basics!
