## Static invoke
Static invoking lets you invoke UltEvents right in the editor, even when not in play mode. Demonstrated below:

You can always do this, but watch out! You can't CTRL + Z out of this one - make sure you save what you need if your event is destructive!!

## Copying events
To copy/paste a singular event from a list, you need to click the 3 line bar at the side of the event:

Then, you can do your action. (The usual keybinds work - CTRL + C/V. If for some reason they don't, right click it.)
