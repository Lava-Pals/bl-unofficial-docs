title: 5. Crawling the Hierarchy with Transform.Find
---

This guide covers how to use [`Transform.Find`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Find.html) to find objects in the scene - including info on how to abuse its undocumented behaviour.

This can be very useful for [[Parenting Things to the Player Rig]], as well as for other scenarios that require references to GameObjects inaccessible out of the editor.

## Crawling up the Ancestry Tree

You can use the `../` syntax to traverse to the parent of an object.

The below gif showcases using this to parent an object (`ParentToFloop`) to another one that exists inside of the parent (`Floop`):

## Crawling Down from the Scene Root

Similarly, appending `/` to the start of a path will base your path on the *root of the scene*.

This example showcases using `/` at the start to search the root, look inside of the `Floop` GameObject, then finally parent to `Bar`:
